## First Time Setup

If this is the first time using the system, you need to initialize the database:

1. Visit: `https://your-domain.com/api/admin/setup`
2. This creates the necessary database tables
3. You only need to do this once

## That's It!

All changes you make will be immediately visible on the `/premade` page where customers shop for prepainted miniatures.
